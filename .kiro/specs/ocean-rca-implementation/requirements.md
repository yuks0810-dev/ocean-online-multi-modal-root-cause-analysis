# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing OCEAN (Online Multi-modal Causal structure lEArNiNG), a novel approach for root cause analysis in microservice systems as described in the paper "Online Multi-modal Root Cause Analysis (arXiv:2410.10021v1)". The implementation will reproduce the paper's methodology using publicly available datasets, focusing on multi-modal data processing (metrics and logs) and online causal structure learning for fault diagnosis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to set up a complete development environment with all necessary dependencies, so that I can implement and experiment with the OCEAN model effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the environment setup is initiated THEN the system SHALL install Python 3.9+ with all required libraries
2. WHEN PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric are installed THEN the system SHALL verify GPU compatibility for deep learning operations
3. WHEN all dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL create a requirements.txt file for reproducibility
4. WHEN the environment is ready THEN the system SHALL provide verification scripts to confirm all components work correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to acquire and preprocess multi-modal datasets from public sources, so that I can train and evaluate the OCEAN model with realistic microservice data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dataset selection is performed THEN the system SHALL prioritize RCAEval and LEMMA-RCA datasets for their multi-modal nature
2. WHEN datasets are downloaded THEN the system SHALL organize them in a structured directory format
3. WHEN metrics data is processed THEN the system SHALL normalize time-series data and create temporal sequences
4. WHEN log data is processed THEN the system SHALL extract log templates and convert them to numerical vectors using BERT or similar models
5. WHEN trace data is processed THEN the system SHALL construct service dependency graphs with adjacency matrices
6. WHEN data preprocessing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide synchronized DataLoader classes for batch processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to implement the core OCEAN model architecture with all its components, so that I can reproduce the paper's methodology accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Dilated CNN component THEN the system SHALL process temporal metrics data with appropriate kernel sizes and dilation rates
2. WHEN implementing the Graph Neural Network component THEN the system SHALL use PyTorch Geometric to handle service relationship propagation
3. WHEN implementing Multi-factor Attention THEN the system SHALL weight different metrics and log features dynamically
4. WHEN implementing Graph Fusion Module THEN the system SHALL use contrastive mutual information maximization to fuse multi-modal graph representations
5. WHEN integrating all components THEN the system SHALL create a unified OCEAN model class that processes multi-modal inputs to output root cause scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to implement online learning capabilities, so that the model can process data sequentially and update incrementally as described in the paper.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN online learning is implemented THEN the system SHALL process data in temporal order rather than batch processing
2. WHEN model updates occur THEN the system SHALL update parameters incrementally at each time step
3. WHEN handling streaming data THEN the system SHALL maintain a sliding window approach for temporal dependencies
4. WHEN memory management is required THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data structures to handle continuous processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to train the OCEAN model with appropriate loss functions, so that it learns to identify root causes effectively from multi-modal data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining loss functions THEN the system SHALL combine root cause prediction loss with contrastive learning loss for graph fusion
2. WHEN training begins THEN the system SHALL split datasets into training and testing sets chronologically
3. WHEN model training progresses THEN the system SHALL log training metrics and convergence information
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL save model weights and training history for evaluation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics, so that I can compare results with the original paper and baseline methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy@K metrics
2. WHEN comparing with baselines THEN the system SHALL use the same evaluation protocols as provided in RCAEval dataset
3. WHEN measuring efficiency THEN the system SHALL record processing time and computational resource usage
4. WHEN evaluation completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance reports with statistical significance tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to conduct ablation studies, so that I can understand the contribution of each OCEAN component to the overall performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ablation study is initiated THEN the system SHALL create model variants with specific components disabled
2. WHEN testing without Graph Fusion THEN the system SHALL evaluate performance using only single-modal representations
3. WHEN testing without Multi-factor Attention THEN the system SHALL use uniform weighting for all features
4. WHEN testing without Dilated CNN THEN the system SHALL use standard CNN or alternative temporal processing
5. WHEN ablation study completes THEN the system SHALL provide comparative analysis showing each component's impact

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to reproduce and validate the paper's main claims, so that I can confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the OCEAN approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reproducing effectiveness claims THEN the system SHALL demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods
2. WHEN reproducing efficiency claims THEN the system SHALL show faster processing times compared to offline methods
3. WHEN validating multi-modal benefits THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved performance when using both metrics and logs versus single modality
4. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive report comparing reproduced results with original paper claims

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want comprehensive documentation and code organization, so that the implementation is reproducible and can be extended by other researchers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is organized THEN the system SHALL follow clear modular structure with separate files for each component
2. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL include detailed README with setup instructions and usage examples
3. WHEN experiments are documented THEN the system SHALL provide scripts to reproduce all reported results
4. WHEN code is finalized THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive comments and docstrings for all functions and classes
